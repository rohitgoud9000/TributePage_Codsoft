                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ He was the first non-Congress prime minister to serve a full term in the office. 
                Vajpayee was one of the co-founders 
                and a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party.<br><br>
                ☛ He was a member of the RSS, 
                a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. 
                He was also a Hindi poet and a writer.<br><br>
                ☛ He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, 
                having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, 
                the lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, 
                the upper house.<br><br>
                ☛ He served as the Member of Parliament from the Lucknow constituency, 
                retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. 
                He was among the founding members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, 
                of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. <br><br> 
                ☛ The BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party, 
                which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, 
                Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister, Morarji Desai. 
                He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. 
                Former members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh formed the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980, 
                with Vajpayee its first president.<br><br>
                ☛ During his tenure as prime minister, 
                India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. 
                Vajpayee sought to improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, 
                travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. 
                After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, 
                he sought to restore relations through engagement with President Pervez Musharraf, 
                inviting him to India for a summit at Agra.<br><br> 
                ☛ Vajpayee's government introduced many domestic economic and infrastructural reforms, 
                including encouraging the private sector and foreign investments, reducing governmental waste, 
                encouraging research and development and privatisation of some government owned corporations.<br><br> 
                ☛ During his tenure, India's security was threatened by a number of violent 
                incidents including 2001 Indian Parliament attack
                 and 2002 Gujarat riots which ultimately caused his defeat in 2004 general election..<br><br> 
                ☛ The administration of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, 
                would be marked as Good Governance Day. In 2015, 
                he was conferred India's highest civilian honour — Bharat Ratna, 
                by the then-President of India, Pranab Mukherjee. 
                He died in 2018 of age-related illness.
                <br><br> ☛ Vajpayee was born into a Kanyakubja Brahmin family on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.
                <br><br> ☛ Vajpayee did his schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gwalior. 
                In 1934, he was admitted to the Anglo-Vernacular Middle (AVM) School in Barnagar, 
                Ujjain district, after his father joined as headmaster.
                <br><br> ☛ He subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College, 
                Agra University (now Maharani Laxmi Bai Govt. College of Excellence) 
                where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. 
                He completed his post-graduation with 
                a Master of Arts in political science from DAV College, Kanpur, Agra University.
                <br><br> ☛ His activism started in Gwalior with Arya Kumar Sabha, 
                the youth wing of the Arya Samaj movement, 
                of which he became the general secretary in 1944.
                <br><br> ☛ He also joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1939 as a swayamsevak, 
                or volunteer. Influenced by Babasaheb Apte, 
                he attended the Officers Training Camp of the RSS during 1940 to 1944, 
                becoming a pracharak (RSS terminology for a full-time worker) in 1947.
                <br><br> ☛ Vajpayee was arrested along with several other o
                pposition leaders during the Internal Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.
                <br><br> ☛ Vajpayee had a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech.
                <br><br> ☛ His health had been a major source of concern; 
                reports said he was reliant on a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. 
                He also had dementia and long-term diabetes. For many years, 
                he had not attended any public engagements 
                and rarely ventured out of the house, 
                except for checkups at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences.
